# Anti Captcha
A collection of techniques in solving captcha problems.

## Solving Captcha using Bitmap Model
Captcha solved by using bitmap model of characters.

## Solving Captcha using Neural Network Model
Captcha solved by using Deep learning with Tensorflow and Keras.

## Solving Captcha using Trained NN Model via Tesseract
Save time modeling and training, immediately use the trained Neural Network LSTM in Tesseract via Python subprocess.

## Recognizing Image using Trained NN Model via TesserOCR
Save time modeling and training, immediately use the trained Neural Network LSTM in Tesseract via Python call to C binding.
